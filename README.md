This is a port of [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks).

shadowsocks is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you <del>bypass firewalls</del>.

## Dependencies

* libcrypto (OpenSSL)
* libsodium >= 1.0.7 (Required for ciphers that are provided by libsodium)

```bash

# macOS
brew install libsodium
brew install openssl

```

## Usage

### **crates.io**

Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/shadowsocks-rust):

```bash
cargo install shadowsocks-rust
```

then you can find `sslocal` and `ssserver` in `$CARGO_HOME/bin`.

### **Download release**

Requirements:

* Linux x86\_64

Download static-linked build [here](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/releases).

### **Build from source**

Use cargo to build.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

NOTE: If you haven't installed the correct version of `libsodium` in your system, you can set a environment variable `SODIUM_BUILD_STATIC=yes` to let `libsodium-ffi` to build `libsodium` from source, which requires you to have build tools (including GCC, libtools, etc.) installed.

```bash
SODIUM_BUILD_STATIC=yes cargo build --release
```

Then `sslocal` and `ssserver` will appear in `./target/(debug|release)/`, it works similarly as the two binaries in the official ShadowSocks' implementation.

```bash
make install
```

Then `sslocal`, `ssserver` and `ssurl` will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` (variable PREFIX).
 
### **Build standalone binaries**

Requirements:

* Docker

```bash
./build/build-release
```

Then `sslocal`, `ssserver` and `ssurl` will be packaged in

- `./build/shadowsocks-latest-release.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
- `./build/shadowsocks-latest-release.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz`

Read `Cargo.toml` for more details.

## Getting Started

Create a ShadowSocks' configuration file. Example

```json
{
    "server": "my_server_ip",
    "server_port": 8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "local_port": 1080,
    "password": "mypassword",
    "timeout": 300,
    "method": "aes-256-cfb"
}
```

Detailed explaination could be found in [shadowsocks' documentation](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki).

In shadowsocks-rust, we also have an extended configuration file format, which is able to define more than one servers:

```json
{
    "servers": [
        {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1080,
            "password": "hello-world",
            "method": "bf-cfb",
            "timeout": 300,
        },
        {
            "address": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1081,
            "password": "hello-kitty",
            "method": "aes-128-cfb"
        }
    ],
    "local_port": 8388,
    "local_address": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

The `sslocal` will use a load balancing algorithm to dispatch packages to all servers.

Start local and server ShadowSocks with
If you Build it with Makefile:
```bash
sslocal -c config.json
ssserver -c config.json
```
If you Build it with Cargo:
```
cargo run --bin sslocal -- -c config.json
cargo run --bin ssserver -- -c config.json
```

List all available arguments with `-h`.

## Supported Ciphers

### Stream Ciphers
* `aes-128-cfb`, `aes-128-cfb1`, `aes-128-cfb8`, `aes-128-cfb128`
* `aes-256-cfb`, `aes-256-cfb1`, `aes-256-cfb8`, `aes-256-cfb128`
* `rc4`, `rc4-md5`
* `chacha20`, `salsa20`, `chacha20-ietf`
* `dummy` (No encryption, just for debugging)

### AEAD Ciphers
* `aes-128-gcm`, `aes-192-gcm`, `aes-256-gcm`
* `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`

## Useful Tools

1. `ssurl` is for encoding and decoding ShadowSocks URLs (SIP002). Example: 

```plain
ss://YWVzLTI1Ni1jZmI6cGFzc3dvcmQ@127.0.0.1:8388/?plugin=obfs-local%3Bobfs%3Dhttp%3Bobfs-host%3Dwww.baidu.com
```

## Notes

It supports the following features:

- [x] Socks5 CONNECT command
- [x] UDP ASSOCIATE command (partial)
- [ ] <del>HTTP Proxy protocol</del> Deprecated, use `privoxy` instead.
- [x] Various crypto algorithms
- [x] Load balancing (multiple servers)
- [x] [SIP004](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/30) AEAD ciphers
- [x] [SIP003](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/28) Plugins
- [x] [SIP002](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/27) Extension ss URLs

## TODO

- [x] Documentation
- [x] Extend configuration format
- [x] Improved logging format (waiting for the new official log crate)
- [ ] Support more ciphers without depending on `libcrypto` (waiting for an acceptable Rust crypto lib implementation)
- [x] Windows support. <del>(Depending on mio and coio-rs)</del>
- [x] Build with stable. <del>(Depending on coio)</del>
- [ ] <del>Support HTTP Proxy protocol</del> (it is easy to use another tools to convert HTTP proxy protocol to Socks5, like `privoxy`)
- [ ] <del>One-time Auth.</del> (Already deprecated according to Shadowsocks' community)
- [x] AEAD ciphers. (proposed in [SIP004](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/30), still under discussion)
