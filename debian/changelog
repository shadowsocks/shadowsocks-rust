  ## Features

  - #1560 PingBalancer check Firefox portal allowing `200` HTTP status

shadowsocks-rust (1.20.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Users are encourage to update to this version if using 1.19.4 to 1.20.0.

  ## Features

  - `shadowsocks-service`: Updated [`rustls`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) to v0.23 with [`ring`](https://crates.io/crates/ring) backend.

shadowsocks-rust (1.20.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  ## Breaking Changes

  - #887 shadowsocks stream cipher (`TABLE`) doesn't need to make a derived key instead of using user's predefined key directly. This change will make shadowsocks-rust not going to be compatible with its older version. Users who are using `TABLE` cipher should upgrade all your local and server instances to the latest version of shadowsocks-rust. On the other hand, `TABLE` cipher is marked deprecated because it is vulnerable, users **must** migrate to other more secured methods immediately.

shadowsocks-rust (1.19.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  ## Features

  - Rollback `rustls` to v0.22, v0.23 first introduced `aws-lc` as the default crypto implementation, but it cannot be built on some targets if there are still older versions of `rustls` in the dependency tree.
  - `local-tun`: Switch from `tun` to `tun2`, which is a fork of `tun`. `tun` seems to be abandoned.

This experimental feature could be useful when using `local-tun`, `local-redir` or other features that could only receive IP destinations, the domain name that is resolved by the Fake-DNS will be translated from IP back to domain name when connecting to the remote.
  - #1500 Add `launchd_udp_socket_name`, `launchd_tcp_socket_name` to basic config format

  ## Bug Fixes

  - Fixed build on OpenBSD
  - #1491 Fixed per-server outbound options not taking effect

shadowsocks-rust (1.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  Complete refactored the whole implementation and splits into 3 different crates:

  * shadowsocks - Core feature of shadowsocks
  * shadowsocks-service - Service library for implementing Local Server, Remote Server, Manager Server
  * shadowsocks-rust - Binary crate for release

  Replaced libsodium and libcrypto with [crypto2](https://github.com/shadowsocks/crypto2).

  ## Features

  * Support setting SO_MARK, SO_BINDTODEVICE on Linux
  * Support setting SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF for TCP sockets
  * Support [SIP008](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues/89 "Online config") extend server fields server, server_port, remarks
  * Local DNS Relay
      * Support sending TCP and UDP queries simutaneously
      * Support connection reusability
  * Remove mostly TCP timeout setting for tunnels, connections will only be killed if clients or servers close
  * Auto-reload DNS resolver configuration from /etc/resolv.conf on *NIX platforms.
  * [#379](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/379 "希望通过传递参数方式，指定多线程模式下tokio启动的线程数") Allow customizing number of worker-threads for multi-threaded scheduler.
  * [#401](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/401 "Lazy server disable implementation") Support field disabled in extended server configuration
  * Ping Balancer
      * Treat timeouts as failures, so requests that receive no response count as failures.
      * Increase check timeout from 2s to 5s to avoid penalties on slow servers.
      * Increase check interval from 6s to 10s.
  * `--outbound-bind-interface` is now supported in both Linux and macOS
  * [#352](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/352 "Add command line arguments to control incoming/outgoing send/receive socket OS buffer size") Support customizing inbound and outbound sockets' SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF by command line options

  ## Library Update

  * [tokio v1.0](https://tokio.rs/blog/2020-12-tokio-1-0)
  * [shadowsocks-crypto](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-crypto), [crypto2](https://github.com/shadowsocks/crypto2)

  ## Optimization

  * UDP Relays sending respond packets directly to UdpSocket instead of channel, which will significantly improve respond latency
  * [#408](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/408 "using crate spin without feature "std" causes performance problem") Enable std features for the spin crate to enable yielding threads when spinning on waiting.

  ## BUG Fixes

  * Unified UDP relay association implementation for less duplicated code.
  * Deprecated `single-threaded` build feature, replaced by `multi-threaded`.
  * Disable stream ciphers by default. Could be enabled with feature `stream-cipher`.
  * Enable IPv6 dual stack mode by default when listening on `::`.

  * Refactored PingBalancer for supporting customized Server Configuration structure
      * For Example: HTTP sslocal can stores HttpClients into the ServerScore structure instead of putting them into a HashMap.
  * Removed trust-dns feature gate, set as default.

shadowsocks-rust (1.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  ## Features

  * A new binary `sstunnel`. Establish TCP and UDP tunnels to remote. Discussion: #177
      ```
      # Establish an UDP tunnel to 8.8.8.8:53 (just like what ssdns did in the past)
      sstunnel -c config.json -f '8.8.8.8:53' -u
      ```
  * Uses `async/await` syntax (requires `rustc` version >= `v1.40.0`)
  * Dependencies
      * `tokio` - `v0.2`
      * `trust-dns-resolver` - `v0.18`
      * `libsodium-sys` (switched from `libsodium-ffi` for better build process)
  * Ping balancer
      * Calculate scores not only with servers' latency, but also availability
      * Supports UDP relay
  * Retry 3 times if it connects failed to remote proxy server automatically

  ## Bug Resolved

  * Refactored UDP relay. Now it works just like NAT. Discussion: #168
  * Temporary workaround for UdpSocket `WSAECONNRESET`. Discussion: #179
      * Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30749423/is-winsock-error-10054-wsaeconnreset-normal-with-udp-to-from-localhost

  ## Breaking Changes

  * Removed `ssdns`. `sstunnel` can fulfill its job.

  ## Releases

  * `shadowsocks-v1.8.0-stable.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.xz`
      * SHA256 `5ec41d5a306715e455b1012de0ddaa33273970689b6df48ffbb0da5fb6083531`

shadowsocks-rust (1.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  ## Refactors

  * #141 Build with Rust 2018.
  * #100 Migrated to Tokio Runtime.
  * #139 Refactor for using as a library. Move signal monitor outside of shadowsocks library.

  ## Dependencies

  * Replaced `ToSocketAddrs` with `trust-dns`
  * #111 Upgrade rand to v0.5 and use `ThreadRng`
  * #132 Feature gate RC4 cipher
  * `--feature miscreant` is now can be built with stable.

  ## Configurations

  * Support timeout key in the outer object in configuration ( `{ "timeout": 30 }` )
  * UDP relay sets timeout with separated key `udp_timeout`
  * #123 `set_nodelay` and `set_keepalive`, `no_delay` is configurable in configuration
  * [Breaking] Replace `enable_udp` with `mode`, possible values are: `tcp_and_udp`, `tcp_only`, `udp_only`.

  ## Bugfix

  * [BUG-FIXED] #105 Fixed "Too many open files" in UDP relay.
  * [BUG-FIXED] Fixed bug while starting UDP relay. While starting server with plugins, it should not change the listening addresses for UDP relay, which are only for TCP relay.
  * [BUG-FIXED] #106 Server should not panic if accepted socket closed right after `accept()`.
  * Implemented a new `ssdns` server, which can serve as a DNS server and proxy DNS queries via ShadowSocks' UDP relay.
  * [FIXED-BUG] #118 #122 Fixed DNS resolving issue. It may failed to resolve remote server's address if you haven't configured any IP addresses in forbidden_ip section.

  ## New features

  * Uses `impl Trait` for functions
  * #113 Supported `xchacha20-ietf-poly1305` encrypt method
  * Removed all global states in client and servers, which will allow starting multiple ShadowSocks instances in one process.
  * Uses `json5` to parse config file.
  * #85 Support `ss-manager` report protocol. (Can co-operate with `ss-manager`)
